* standardize the format of a module
* redesign the MM
* Initialize each module in a separate activation ("thread") using setTimeout
* Dynamic initialization of modules (related to point 3) : means there is a function that looks like " MM_init_module( m ) "
* format of MM_conf, and whether CSS can be called in from the module
* include popular libraries like jQuery in common.js -> AJAX request scheduler
* explore the possibility of INCLUDING MODULE CODE in the page via PHP --> less ajax, more file size, php processes the page/mmconf.json

AJAX req scheduler can also change the way module manager is implemented.

* how to handle resource duplication? 

* integration with Google Gears for applications with LARGE num of modules
