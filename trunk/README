NAMESPACE:              jscms_* for both php and js files. this applies only to global functions.

/themes                 directory for all themes
                        name of theme manager is (by convention) the same as that of the theme
/modules                directory for all modules
/page			generic name for a "page" (application view)

THEME has:
    1. an html page called "index.theme"
    2. it must reference all its resources (css, js, imgs etc) via the relative path
       "../themes/<theme-name>/". This is because the theme actually "executes" in the
       page directory
    3. It is essentially a php file, and it gets an object $pageconf, that contains configurable
       stuff like header text, title of the page (<title>) etc.
    4. It must include <?php jscms_include_common_js(); ?> in the header, and 
       <?php jscms_include_mm(); ?> just before the end of </body>.
    5. It must have an associated module having the same name as the theme that provides common
       resources like "header", "body", "sidebar", "footer", "navbar", "navitem" etc to
       other modules as part of its "productions".

MODULE has:
    1. id = ""
	id == module_name
	read only property, must not be modified.
    2. init( conf )
	@conf the configuration object that defines the characteristics of the module. 
	does initialization (acquisition of resources etc)
	does NOT start operation of the module! that is done by main().
	RETURNS true on success, false on failure
    3. main()
	this starts the operation of the module
	this must not fail! operation (acquiring resources etc) must be done in init(). main()
	works as the GO button, and init() is the START button.
	RETURNS nothing (always succeeds).
    4. unload()
	RETURNS true on success, false on failure
    5. service_request( res )
	@res the resource requested from the module
	RETURNS resource object on success, null on failure
    6. req = {}
	read only property, must not be modified.
    7. prod = {}
	read only property, must not be modified.
    
FORMAT of PAGE:
    1. page essentially is a directory in the root directory of Oyster, that has: index.php,
       pageconf.json, mmconf.json, mmconf.js.php and all module config files (preferrably
       in a separate directory called moduleconf/).
    2. pageconf.json has page config stuff like the theme to use, header text, title of the
       page etc.
    3. mmconf.json has list of modules, their id and associated conf files. Note that the
       theme manager module is automatically appended to this list by jscms_include_mm().
       This file is parsed as php (its included in mmconf.js.php).
    4. mmconf.js.php basically converts mmconf.json into the MM_conf js object.
